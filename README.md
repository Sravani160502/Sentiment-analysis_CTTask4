Task Description : 
As part of Task-4 of the internship at CODTECH, the objective was to perform sentiment analysis on a large dataset containing approximately 680,000 textual records. The core goal of the task was to identify and categorize the sentiment behind each entry, labeling them as positive, negative, or neutral based on the content. The dataset used was a structured CSV file, which included fields such as user-generated text, gender, topic, and date. Initially, data preprocessing was carried out, involving the removal of missing values and unwanted characters, standardizing text by converting it to lowercase, and eliminating extra spaces. Basic statistical features like word count and character count were also computed to gain insights into the text length and verbosity across different entries. Using a rule-based polarity scoring mechanism from the TextBlob library, a preliminary sentiment label was assigned to each text based on its computed polarity value. A second sentiment scoring method, VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), was then applied to the cleaned text to produce more robust and interpretable sentiment labels. Visualization techniques were employed throughout the analysis to enhance understanding and communication of results. Bar plots were generated to show the average word count across sentiment categories and the distribution of most common topics. A time-based analysis was also included, where dates were converted into datetime format and the number of posts per year was plotted to identify content trends over time. Furthermore, word clouds and frequency-based charts were utilized to visually highlight common vocabulary associated with different sentiment classes. The project also explored demographic-based sentiment patterns by grouping sentiments by gender and calculating both raw counts and percentage distributions. This revealed potential differences in sentiment expression across user demographics. The processed data, along with the computed sentiment labels, was then exported to a new CSV file for future use, archiving the results for model deployment or dashboard creation. All steps in this project were executed in a Jupyter Notebook environment, with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TextBlob, and NLTK facilitating data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. By completing this task, a strong understanding was developed in working with large-scale textual datasets, cleaning and analyzing user-generated content, applying rule-based sentiment classifiers, and presenting findings through meaningful visual summaries. The project demonstrates practical experience in managing data pipelines and performing end-to-end data analysis from raw import to final export. It equips the intern with valuable skills in data handling, interpretation of results, and creating visual stories from complex datasets—skills that are increasingly vital in today’s data-centric industries. Moreover, this task provided hands-on experience in sentiment-related work that can be extended to various domains such as customer feedback systems, blog post analysis, or brand reputation monitoring, making it a versatile and insightful data science exercise.
